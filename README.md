# SentinelAuth

**Full-Stack Authentication & RBAC Platform** built with MERN, TypeScript, Zod, Tailwind — inspired by Auth0 & Clerk.dev.

## 🔐 Motivation

Authentication is critical for every SaaS product, but implementing it securely and scalably is complex. SentinelAuth offers a developer-first, extensible solution — simple to integrate, easy to scale, and secure by default.

- 🔐 **Authentication**: JWT-based login flow
- 🧪 **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- 💾 **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript + MongoDB
- 🎨 **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
